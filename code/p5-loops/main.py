# WHILE LOOPS

# EXAMPLE OF AN INFINITE LOOP
# we are not chancing x and 10 is always smaller than 100
# x = 10
# while x < 100:
#     print("YAY")
#
# print("THE END")


# counter = 0
# while counter < 5:
#     print("Hello")
#     counter = counter + 1
#
# print("while loop is over")

counter = 1
while counter < 10:
    if counter % 3 == 0:
        print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1
