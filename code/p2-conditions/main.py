# Operators we have learned so far

#  =   for attributing a value to a variable
#  +  -  *  /   %    for Math operations
#  +  can also be used for concatenation

# CONDITIONAL OPERATORS
#    ==     VALUES ARE THE SAME
#    !=     VALUES ARE DIFFERENT
#    >      IS BIGGER
#    <      IS SMALLER
#    >=     IS BIGGER OR IS EQUAL
#    <=     IS SMALLER OR IS EQUAL

#   the result of a conditional operation is a Boolean / Bool
