# a range with a size of 6
# starts at 0 and has 6 values
# so the first value is 0 and the last value is 5
numbers = range(6)


# example of a range that starts at 4 and ends at 9
moreNumbers = range(4, 10)

# counter = 0
# while counter < 6:
#     print(counter)
#     counter = counter + 1

for counter in range(6):

# exercise
# using a for loop
# print all the multiples of 5 between 1 and 100
